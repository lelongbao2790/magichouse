# Code Generation - Detailed Steps

## Overview
This stage generates code for each unit of work through two integrated parts:
- **Part 1 - Planning**: Create detailed code generation plan with explicit steps
- **Part 2 - Generation**: Execute approved plan to generate code, tests, and artifacts

**Note**: For brownfield projects, "generate" means modify existing files when appropriate, not create duplicates.

## Prerequisites
- Unit Design Generation must be complete for the unit
- NFR Implementation (if executed) must be complete for the unit
- All unit design artifacts must be available
- Unit is ready for code generation

---

# PART 1: PLANNING

## Step 1: Analyze Unit Context
- [ ] Read unit design artifacts from Unit Design Generation
- [ ] Read unit story map to understand assigned stories
- [ ] Identify unit dependencies and interfaces
- [ ] Validate unit is ready for code generation

## Step 2: Create Detailed Unit Code Generation Plan
- [ ] Read workspace root and project type from `aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/aidlc-state.md`
- [ ] Determine code location (see Critical Rules for structure patterns)
- [ ] **Brownfield only**: Review reverse engineering code-structure.md for existing files to modify
- [ ] Document exact paths (never aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/)
- [ ] Create explicit steps for unit generation:
  - Project Structure Setup (greenfield only)
  - Business Logic Generation
  - Business Logic Unit Testing
  - Business Logic Summary
  - API Layer Generation
  - API Layer Unit Testing
  - API Layer API Tests (see API Test Generation Rules below)
  - API Layer Summary
  - Repository Layer Generation
  - Repository Layer Unit Testing
  - Repository Layer Summary
  - Frontend Components Generation (if applicable)
  - Frontend Components Unit Testing (if applicable)
  - Frontend Components Summary (if applicable)
  - Database Migration Scripts (if data models exist)
  - E2E Test Spec Generation (from TC-E cases in test-case-design.md — if Test Case Design was executed)
  - Manual Test Checklist Generation (from TC-M cases in test-case-design.md — if Test Case Design was executed)
  - Documentation Generation (API docs, README updates)
  - Deployment Artifacts Generation
- [ ] Number each step sequentially
- [ ] Include story mapping references
- [ ] Add checkboxes [ ] for each step

## Step 3: Include Unit Generation Context
- [ ] For this unit, include:
  - Stories implemented by this unit
  - Dependencies on other units/services
  - Expected interfaces and contracts
  - Database entities owned by this unit
  - Service boundaries and responsibilities

## Step 4: Create Unit Plan Document
- [ ] Save complete plan as `aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/construction/plans/{unit-name}-code-generation-plan.md`
- [ ] Include step numbering (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
- [ ] Include unit context and dependencies
- [ ] Include story traceability
- [ ] Ensure plan is executable step-by-step
- [ ] Emphasize that this plan is the single source of truth for Code Generation

## Step 5: Summarize Unit Plan
- [ ] Provide summary of the unit code generation plan to the user
- [ ] Highlight unit generation approach
- [ ] Explain step sequence and story coverage
- [ ] Note total number of steps and estimated scope

## Step 6: Log Approval Prompt
- [ ] Before asking for approval, log the prompt with timestamp in `aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/audit.md`
- [ ] Include reference to the complete unit code generation plan
- [ ] Use ISO 8601 timestamp format

## Step 7: Wait for Explicit Approval
- [ ] Do not proceed until the user explicitly approves the unit code generation plan
- [ ] Approval must cover the entire plan and generation sequence
- [ ] If user requests changes, update the plan and repeat approval process

## Step 8: Record Approval Response
- [ ] Log the user's approval response with timestamp in `aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/audit.md`
- [ ] Include the exact user response text
- [ ] Mark the approval status clearly

## Step 9: Update Progress
- [ ] Mark Code Generation Part 1 (Planning) complete in `aidlc-state.md`
- [ ] Update the "Current Status" section
- [ ] Prepare for transition to Code Generation

---

# PART 2: GENERATION

## Step 10: Load Unit Code Generation Plan
- [ ] Read the complete plan from `aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/construction/plans/{unit-name}-code-generation-plan.md`
- [ ] Identify the next uncompleted step (first [ ] checkbox)
- [ ] Load the context for that step (unit, dependencies, stories)

## Step 11: Execute Current Step
- [ ] Verify target directory from plan (never aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/)
- [ ] **Brownfield only**: Check if target file exists
- [ ] Generate exactly what the current step describes:
  - **If file exists**: Modify it in-place (never create `ClassName_modified.java`, `ClassName_new.java`, etc.)
  - **If file doesn't exist**: Create new file
- [ ] Write to correct locations:
  - **Application Code**: Workspace root per project structure
  - **Documentation**: `aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/construction/{unit-name}/code/` (markdown only)
  - **Build/Config Files**: Workspace root
- [ ] Follow unit story requirements
- [ ] Respect dependencies and interfaces

## Step 12: Update Progress
- [ ] Mark the completed step as [x] in the unit code generation plan
- [ ] Mark associated unit stories as [x] when their generation is finished
- [ ] Update `aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/aidlc-state.md` current status
- [ ] **Brownfield only**: Verify no duplicate files created (e.g., no `ClassName_modified.java` alongside `ClassName.java`)
- [ ] Save all generated artifacts

## Step 13: Continue or Complete Generation
- [ ] If more steps remain, return to Step 10
- [ ] If all steps complete, proceed to present completion message

## Step 14: Present Completion Message
- Present completion message in this structure:
     1. **Completion Announcement** (mandatory): Always start with this:

```markdown
# 💻 Code Generation Complete - [unit-name]
```

     2. **AI Summary** (optional): Provide structured bullet-point summary
        - **Brownfield**: Distinguish modified vs created files (e.g., "• Modified: `src/services/user-service.ts`", "• Created: `src/services/auth-service.ts`")
        - **Greenfield**: List created files with paths (e.g., "• Created: `src/services/user-service.ts`")
        - List tests, documentation, deployment artifacts with paths
        - Keep factual, no workflow instructions
     3. **Formatted Workflow Message** (mandatory): Always end with this exact format:

```markdown
> **📋 <u>**REVIEW REQUIRED:**</u>**  
> Please examine the generated code at:
> - **Application Code**: `[actual-workspace-path]`
> - **Documentation**: `aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/construction/[unit-name]/code/`



> **🚀 <u>**WHAT'S NEXT?**</u>**
>
> **You may:**
>
> 🔧 **Request Changes** - Ask for modifications to the generated code based on your review  
> ✅ **Continue to Next Stage** - Approve code generation and proceed to **[next-unit/Build & Test]**

---
```

## Step 15: Wait for Explicit Approval
- Do not proceed until the user explicitly approves the generated code
- Approval must be clear and unambiguous
- If user requests changes, update the code and repeat the approval process

## Step 16: Record Approval and Update Progress
- Log approval in audit.md with timestamp
- Record the user's approval response with timestamp
- Mark Code Generation stage as complete for this unit in aidlc-state.md

## Critical Rules

### Code Location Rules
- **Application code**: Workspace root only (NEVER aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/)
- **Documentation**: aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/ only (markdown summaries)
- **Read workspace root** from aidlc-state.md before generating code

**Structure patterns by project type**:
- **Brownfield**: Use existing structure (e.g., `src/main/java/`, `lib/`, `pkg/`)
- **Greenfield single unit**: `src/`, `tests/`, `config/` in workspace root
- **Greenfield multi-unit (microservices)**: `{unit-name}/src/`, `{unit-name}/tests/`
- **Greenfield multi-unit (monolith)**: `src/{unit-name}/`, `tests/{unit-name}/`

### Brownfield File Modification Rules
- Check if file exists before generating
- If exists: Modify in-place (never create copies like `ClassName_modified.java`)
- If doesn't exist: Create new file
- Verify no duplicate files after generation (Step 12)

### Planning Phase Rules
- Create explicit, numbered steps for all generation activities
- Include story traceability in the plan
- Document unit context and dependencies
- Get explicit user approval before generation

### Generation Phase Rules
- **NO HARDCODED LOGIC**: Only execute what's written in the unit plan
- **FOLLOW PLAN EXACTLY**: Do not deviate from the step sequence
- **UPDATE CHECKBOXES**: Mark [x] immediately after completing each step
- **STORY TRACEABILITY**: Mark unit stories [x] when functionality is implemented
- **RESPECT DEPENDENCIES**: Only implement when unit dependencies are satisfied

### API Test Generation Rules

When the unit includes an API route/endpoint (REST, GraphQL, RPC), **always** generate a corresponding API test file in the project's API test folder (e.g., `automation_tests/api/`). Do not leave the API test folder empty.

**What API tests must cover** (at minimum):

- Every valid input variant accepted by the route's validation schema — including any new enum values or categories added by this unit
- At least one invalid/rejected case for each validation rule (missing field, wrong type, out-of-range value, unknown enum value)
- The expected HTTP response code or success/error shape for each case

**How to write them** — match the project's existing API test pattern:

- If API tests already exist in the folder: read them first, follow the same import style, `describe` structure, and assertion style
- If the folder is empty: use the same test runner as unit tests (e.g., Vitest), import the validation schema or route handler directly, and keep tests fast (no live server required unless the project already runs one for API tests)
- File naming: `{route-name}.api.test.ts` (or `.spec.ts` to match project convention)

**Ensure the vitest config (or equivalent) includes the API test folder** in its `include` glob. If it does not, add it as part of this step.

### Test Case Design Integration Rules

When `## Test Scope` in `aidlc-state.md` includes a **Test Case Design file** path, read `aidlc-docs/{initiative-slug}/inception/test-cases/test-case-design.md` before generating any UI components or API routes for the unit.

**TC-E (Playwright) spec generation**:
- Generate Playwright spec files in `automation_tests/e2e/` — one spec file per logical group of TC-E cases
- Title each test with the exact TC-E ID and description from the design document (e.g., `"TC-E001 | Grade 2 tab shows Math, Vietnamese, and English subject cards"`)
- Use the `data-testid` selectors listed in each TC-E case's "Assertions" and "data-testid(s) needed" fields
- Add every `data-testid` attribute from the document's "data-testid Attribute Requirements" table to the generated UI components — these are component requirements, not just test hints

**TC-M (Manual checklist) generation**:
- Create or update `MANUAL-TEST-CHECKLIST.md` in the workspace root
- Format each entry as: TC-M number, title, preconditions, numbered steps, expected result, and "what to specifically check"
- This file is the developer's post-deploy verification checklist; do not delete entries from previous initiatives

**If Test Case Design was skipped**: proceed with existing API Test Generation Rules and Automation Friendly Code Rules only.

### Automation Friendly Code Rules
When generating UI code (web, mobile, desktop), ensure elements are automation-friendly:
- Add `data-testid` attributes to interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links, forms)
- Use consistent naming: `{component}-{element-role}` (e.g., `login-form-submit-button`, `user-list-search-input`)
- Avoid dynamic or auto-generated IDs that change between renders
- Keep `data-testid` values stable across code changes (only change when element purpose changes)

## Completion Criteria
- Complete unit code generation plan created and approved
- All steps in unit code generation plan marked [x]
- All unit stories implemented according to plan
- All code and tests generated (tests will be executed in Build & Test phase)
- Deployment artifacts generated
- Complete unit ready for build and verification
